    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
    <h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h2>
    <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC)
        is aprivately funded not-for-profit educational initiative started 
        by President of Pakistan, Dr.Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali,
        and Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business
        opportunities in emerging tech fields like
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
            <LI>Artificial Intelligence</LI>
            <li>Blockchain</li>
            <li>Internet Of Things</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cloud Native Computing:</h2>
        The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> 
        program prepares the students to program in open source technologies
        like, <em>Linux,Docker,Kubernetes,JavaScript,Node.js,React
            and React Native</em> while introducing the sudents to
            development of Microservices and software development 
            techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h2>Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> program of 
        PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the 
        AI technology, via teaching programming in open 
        source languages like <strong>Python,Numpy,Pandas,Tensorflow 2.0
        and Flask,</strong> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions
        and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day
        AI in practice. 
    </p>
    <h2>BlockChain:</h2>
    <p>
        The main emphasis of <strong>BlockChain</strong> program is to understand
        the blockchains like <em><strong>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric),</strong></em>
        and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, Javascript
        on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them
        to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 
        and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service
        (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
        of a crypto-taken.
    </p>
    <h2>Internet of Things:</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> program introduces the
        students to open source development technologies like 
        <em><strong>Rust,Embedded Rust, WebAssembly,Hyper,Diesel,
        Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</strong></em> 
        while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for 
        IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
